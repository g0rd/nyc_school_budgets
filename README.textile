Made this at the #jdcny event at Columbia.

Scrapes school budgets from the NYC Department of Ed site, see for example http://schools.nyc.gov/AboutUs/funding/schoolbudgets/GalaxyAllocationFY2010.htm?BSSS_INPUT=M411

Tricky thing is the markup changed slightly each year... and getting a list of school IDs.

Thanks to Julian Todd for making category part of the row key, this gives a more useful table with tons of rows and not so many columns.

Needs more work to categorize the categories into "major" categories (there are thousands of categories)
